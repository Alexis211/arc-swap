//! Making [`Arc`] itself atomic
//!
//! The [`Arc`] uses atomic reference counters, so the object behind it can be safely pointed to by
//! several threads at once. However, the [`Arc`] itself is quite ordinary â€’ to change its value
//! (make it point somewhere else), one has to be the sole owner of it.
//!
//! On the other hand, there's [`AtomicPtr`]. It can be modified and read from multiple threads,
//! allowing to pass the value from one thread to another without the use of a [`Mutex`]. The
//! downside is, tracking when the data can be safely deleted is hard.
//!
//! This library provides [`ArcSwap`] that allows both at once. It can be constructed from ordinary
//! [`Arc`], but its value can be loaded and stored atomically, my multiple concurrent threads.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! For one, the C++ [`shared_ptr`] has this
//! [ability](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/atomic), so it is only fair to
//! have it too.
//!
//! For another, it seemed like a really good exercise.
//!
//! And finally, there are some real use cases for this functionality. For example, when one thread
//! publishes something (for example configuration) and other threads want to have a peek to the
//! current one from time to time. There's a global [`ArcSwap`], holding the current snapshot and
//! everyone is free to make a copy and hold onto it for a while. The publisher thread simply
//! stores a new snapshot every time and the old configuration gets dropped once all the other
//! threads give up their copies of the pointer.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate arc_swap;
//! extern crate crossbeam_utils;
//!
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! use arc_swap::ArcSwap;
//! use crossbeam_utils::scoped as thread;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let config = ArcSwap::from(Arc::new(String::default()));
//!     thread::scope(|scope| {
//!         scope.spawn(|| {
//!             let new_conf = Arc::new("New configuration".to_owned());
//!             config.store(new_conf);
//!         });
//!         for _ in 0..10 {
//!             scope.spawn(|| {
//!                 loop {
//!                     let cfg = config.load();
//!                     if !cfg.is_empty() {
//!                         assert_eq!(*cfg, "New configuration");
//!                         return;
//!                     }
//!                 }
//!             });
//!         }
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
